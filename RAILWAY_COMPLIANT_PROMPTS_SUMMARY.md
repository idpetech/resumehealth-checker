# Railway-Compliant Prompt System Implementation

## 🎯 **Strategy Implemented**

Based on your analysis, we've implemented a cleaner, more maintainable approach to resolve the JSON parsing issues on Railway staging:

### **1. Split Large JSON into Individual Files**
- **Before**: One massive `prompts.json` file (91 lines, complex nested structure)
- **After**: 6 individual markdown files in `app/data/prompts/`:
  - `resume_analysis_free.md`
  - `resume_analysis_premium.md` 
  - `job_fit_free.md`
  - `job_fit_premium.md`
  - `cover_letter_free.md`
  - `cover_letter_premium.md`

### **2. Reduced Prompt Complexity**
- **Simplified prompts**: Removed excessive nested JSON structures
- **Cleaner format**: Markdown files with clear sections (System Prompt, User Prompt, Tone Guidelines)
- **Shorter content**: Reduced verbosity while maintaining quality
- **Better structure**: Each prompt is self-contained and focused

### **3. Increased Timeout**
- **Before**: 60 seconds timeout
- **After**: 180 seconds timeout for better Railway compliance
- **Reasoning**: Railway environments may have slower response times

### **4. New Architecture**

#### **PromptLoader Service** (`app/services/prompt_loader.py`)
- Simple file-based prompt loading
- Caching for performance
- Error handling for missing files
- Clean separation of concerns

#### **AnalysisServiceV2** (`app/services/analysis_v2.py`)
- Uses individual prompt files instead of complex JSON parsing
- 180-second timeout for Railway compliance
- Simplified error handling
- Better logging for debugging

## 🚀 **Benefits of New Approach**

### **Railway Compliance**
- ✅ **No complex JSON parsing** - eliminates the root cause of parsing errors
- ✅ **Individual file loading** - more reliable than nested JSON structures
- ✅ **Increased timeout** - handles Railway's slower response times
- ✅ **Simplified prompts** - reduces AI response complexity

### **Maintainability**
- ✅ **Easy to edit** - each prompt is in its own file
- ✅ **Version control friendly** - changes are isolated to specific prompts
- ✅ **No JSON escaping issues** - markdown format is more forgiving
- ✅ **Clear structure** - easy to understand and modify

### **Performance**
- ✅ **Faster loading** - individual files load faster than large JSON
- ✅ **Caching** - prompts are cached after first load
- ✅ **Better error handling** - specific errors for missing files

## 📁 **File Structure**

```
app/data/prompts/
├── resume_analysis_free.md      # Free resume analysis prompt
├── resume_analysis_premium.md   # Premium resume analysis prompt
├── job_fit_free.md             # Free job fit analysis prompt
├── job_fit_premium.md          # Premium job fit analysis prompt
├── cover_letter_free.md        # Free cover letter prompt
└── cover_letter_premium.md     # Premium cover letter prompt

app/services/
├── prompt_loader.py            # New prompt loading service
└── analysis_v2.py              # New analysis service with 180s timeout
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Prompt File Format**
Each prompt file follows this structure:
```markdown
# Prompt Title

## System Prompt
[System prompt content]

## User Prompt
[User prompt with {placeholders}]

## Tone Guidelines
[Guidelines for AI behavior]
```

### **API Integration**
- Updated `app/api/routes.py` to use `AnalysisServiceV2`
- All existing endpoints work with new service
- Backward compatibility maintained

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

This implementation should resolve:
- ❌ **JSON parsing errors** (`'\n "overall_score"'`)
- ❌ **Complex prompt processing issues**
- ❌ **Railway timeout problems**
- ❌ **Maintenance difficulties**

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Railway Deployment**: Changes pushed to trigger auto-deployment
2. **Testing**: Test premium analysis on Railway staging
3. **Verification**: Confirm JSON parsing errors are resolved
4. **Cleanup**: Remove old debug logging if successful
