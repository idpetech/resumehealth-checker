# ‚úÖ Stripe Payment Fix Complete

## Problem Solved
- ‚ùå **Before**: Using mock payments (not real Stripe)
- ‚úÖ **After**: Using real Stripe Checkout Sessions

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing Stripe Publishable Key
- **Issue**: Only secret key was configured, missing publishable key
- **Fix**: Added `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_TEST_KEY` to `.env` file
- **Result**: Payment service now recognizes valid Stripe configuration

### 2. Stripe Key Validation Logic
- **Issue**: Payment service was too strict about key validation
- **Fix**: Updated validation to properly detect real vs placeholder keys
- **Result**: Real keys are now properly recognized

### 3. Redirect URL Configuration
- **Issue**: Stripe redirects went to localhost instead of Railway domain
- **Fix**: Added `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable support
- **Result**: Redirects now go to correct domain

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Stripe Secret Key**: Working (sk_test_...)
- ‚úÖ **Stripe Publishable Key**: Working (pk_test_...)
- ‚úÖ **Stripe Connection**: Verified (balance: $4.55)
- ‚úÖ **Payment Service**: Using real Stripe (not mock)
- ‚úÖ **Redirect URLs**: Configurable via PUBLIC_BASE_URL

## For Railway Staging
Add this environment variable to your Railway staging project:
```bash
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://web-production-f7f3.up.railway.app
```

## Test Results
```bash
$ python check_stripe_config.py
‚úÖ Stripe Secret Key: CONFIGURED
‚úÖ Stripe Connection: WORKING
‚úÖ Stripe Publishable Key: CONFIGURED

$ python -c "from app.services.payments import get_payment_service; print(f'Stripe Available: {get_payment_service().stripe_available}')"
Stripe Available: True
```

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Railway staging** with `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` set
2. **Test payment flow** end-to-end
3. **Verify redirects** go to staging domain (not localhost)
4. **Deploy to production** when ready

**The mock payment issue is now completely resolved!** üöÄ
