## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY**

### **Clean Service Layer Pattern**
```
main.py                 # Single entry point
app/core/               # Infrastructure (config, database, exceptions)  
app/services/           # Business logic (OpenAI, Stripe, files, geo)
app/api/                # Interface layer (routes only)
app/data/               # Configuration (JSON, prompts)
database.db             # SQLite database (CURRENTLY 0 BYTES - ISSUE)
```

### **Key Constraints (MANDATORY)**
```
❌ NEVER: Business logic in API routes
❌ NEVER: Direct sqlite3.connect() outside context manager
❌ NEVER: Hardcoded credentials anywhere
✅ ALWAYS: Use get_db_connection() context manager
✅ ALWAYS: Explicit conn.commit() for database changes
✅ ALWAYS: Test all changes before git tagging
```

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT BLOCKING ISSUE DETAILS**

### **Problem Analysis**
```
FUNCTION: init_db() in app/core/database.py
BEHAVIOR: Executes without Python exceptions
ISSUE: Database file remains 0 bytes after execution
EVIDENCE: conn.commit() is present at line 218 but data not persisting
IMPACT: All 9 promotional system tables don't exist
```

### **Tables That Should Exist But Don't**
```
promotional_codes       # Discount codes with rules
promotional_usage       # Usage tracking per session
promotional_sessions    # Session-based validation
credit_accounts         # User credit balances  
credit_transactions     # Credit transaction history
credit_bundles         # Available credit packages
usage_analytics        # User behavior tracking
user_behavior          # Detailed action tracking
marketing_attribution  # Campaign performance tracking
```

### **Root Cause Theories**
```
1. Transaction rollback in context manager (most likely)
2. Database file permissions issue
3. SQLite connection configuration problem  
4. Silent exception not being caught
```

## 🔒 **ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS SUMMARY**

### **Database Rules (CRITICAL)**
```
MANDATORY: All operations use get_db_connection() context manager
MANDATORY: Explicit conn.commit() for all changes
MANDATORY: Parameterized queries only (no SQL injection)
MANDATORY: Foreign key constraints respected
```

### **Service Layer Rules**
```
CONSTRAINT: Services are stateless singletons
CONSTRAINT: No service-to-service direct calls
CONSTRAINT: All external APIs via services only
CONSTRAINT: No business logic in route handlers
```

### **Security Requirements**
```
INVARIANT: All API keys via environment variables only
INVARIANT: No sensitive data in logs
INVARIANT: File processing in-memory only
INVARIANT: Generic error messages to users
```

---

## 📋 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Phase-Based Development (MANDATORY)**
```
RULE: Each phase 100% complete before next phase
RULE: All tests pass before git tagging  
RULE: Baseline tags before major changes
RULE: No deployment without full validation
```

### **Testing Strategy**
```
1. Local testing: python test_phase1_database.py
2. Database verification: All 9 tables exist
3. Class testing: All DB classes operational  
4. Integration testing: Full workflow validation
5. Git tagging: Only after 100% pass rate
```

---

## 🎯 **SESSION WORKFLOW**

### **Before Any Work**
```
1. Complete AI_SESSION_TEMPLATE.md checklist
2. Verify understanding of architectural constraints
3. Check current system state (database.db size)
4. Plan testing strategy for changes
```

### **During Development**
```
1. Follow all architectural constraints strictly
2. Test incrementally and validate changes
3. Document findings in SESSION_CONTEXT_CURRENT.md
4. Use TodoWrite tool for complex tasks
```

### **After Significant Changes**
```
1. Update SESSION_CONTEXT_CURRENT.md with findings
2. Verify architectural constraints still met
3. Run relevant tests to validate changes
4. Plan next steps for session continuity
```
