This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Resume Health Checker v4.0 is a clean, modular FastAPI application that provides AI-powered resume analysis with premium upgrade options. This is a complete rewrite from a previous 3,800-line monolithic version, now architected as a maintainable service with proper separation of concerns.

**Key Features:**
- AI-powered resume analysis (free and premium tiers)
- Multi-format file processing (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Stripe payment integration with regional pricing
- Six supported currencies with geolocation detection
- Multiple premium services (job fit analysis, cover letters, interview prep)

## Architecture

```

### Environment-Based Configuration
- **Local**: Development with hot reload, debug logging, test Stripe keys
- **Staging**: Railway staging deployment with test environment
- **Production**: Railway production with live Stripe keys, optimized logging

## Common Development Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Start development server
python main.py

# Or with uvicorn directly
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Run comprehensive test suite
python test_local.py

# Test specific configuration
python test_config.py
```

### Testing Strategy
The project follows a comprehensive testing approach from local â†’ staging â†’ production:

1. **Local Testing**: `python test_local.py` - Tests all endpoints with real resume files
2. **Stripe Sandbox**: Full payment flow testing with test cards
3. **Railway Staging**: Production-like environment testing
4. **Production Deployment**: Only after all tests pass

### Environment Variables Required

**Core Settings:**
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=local|staging|production
DEBUG=true|false
PORT=8000
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
```

**Stripe Integration:**
```bash
# For local/staging (test keys)
STRIPE_SECRET_TEST_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_TEST_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_TEST_SECRET=whsec_...

# For production (live keys)
STRIPE_SECRET_LIVE_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_LIVE_KEY=pk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_LIVE_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**Railway Deployment:**
```bash
RAILWAY_PRODUCTION_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
DATABASE_PATH=database.db
```

## Development Patterns

### Service Layer Architecture
- **analysis_service**: Singleton for OpenAI integration and AI prompts
- **file_service**: File processing with automatic format detection
- **payment_service**: Stripe integration with environment-aware key selection
- **geo_service**: Regional pricing and currency detection

### Database Design
Simple SQLite with analysis tracking:
- Stores resume analysis results (free/premium)
- Payment status tracking
- Session management for payment flow
- No user accounts (stateless design for v4.0)

### Error Handling
Custom exceptions with structured responses:
- `FileProcessingError`: File upload and processing issues
- `AIAnalysisError`: OpenAI API and analysis failures  
- `PaymentError`: Stripe integration problems
- Global exception handlers provide consistent JSON error responses

### API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints under `/api/v1/`
- File uploads via multipart form data
- Consistent JSON response format
- Environment-specific features (admin endpoints only in dev)

## AI Integration

### OpenAI Configuration
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini` for cost efficiency
- Temperature: `0.7` for balanced creativity/consistency
- Max tokens: `1500` per analysis
- Timeout: `60 seconds` per request

### Prompt Management
AI prompts are externalized in `app/data/prompts.json`:
- **Free Analysis**: Basic resume feedback with upgrade prompts
- **Premium Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis with text rewrites
- **Job Fit Analysis**: Resume-to-job-posting matching
- **Cover Letter**: Tailored cover letter generation

### Response Processing
- JSON response parsing with markdown cleanup
- Fallback handling for malformed AI responses
- Structured error responses when AI calls fail

## Payment Integration

### Stripe Architecture
- Environment-aware key selection (test vs live)
- Regional pricing with 6 supported currencies (USD, PKR, INR, HKD, AED, BDT)
- Session-based payment flow with unique client reference IDs
- Webhook handling for payment verification

### Payment Flow
1. User uploads resume â†’ gets free analysis
2. Premium upgrade creates Stripe payment session
3. Successful payment triggers premium analysis generation
4. Results delivered via success URL with analysis display

## Regional Pricing System

### Supported Regions
- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States (USD)
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Pakistan (PKR) 
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India (INR)
- ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡° Hong Kong (HKD)
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ª UAE (AED)
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡© Bangladesh (BDT)

### Currency Detection
- Automatic geolocation via IP detection
- Manual region override for testing
- Fallback pricing configuration in JSON

## Testing and Deployment

### Local Testing Requirements
- Real resume files for testing (ResumeLAW.docx reference)
- Valid OpenAI API key for AI analysis
- Stripe test keys for payment flow testing
- All tests must pass before deployment

### Railway Deployment
- Auto-deployment from main branch
- Environment variables set via Railway dashboard
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- Logging optimized per environment

### Production Checklist
- âœ… All local tests passing (6/6)
- âœ… Stripe sandbox testing complete
- âœ… Railway staging validated
- âœ… Environment variables configured
- âœ… Webhook endpoints configured in Stripe dashboard

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- No hardcoded secrets (all via environment variables)
- Request validation and sanitization
- File upload size and type restrictions (10MB max, PDF/DOCX/TXT only)
- Stripe webhook signature verification

### Data Handling
- In-memory file processing (no persistent file storage)
- Session-based payment tracking
- SQLite database for analysis results
- No user account system (stateless by design)

## Key Implementation Notes

### File Processing
- PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction
- python-docx for Word document processing
- Automatic file type detection via content type and extension
- Text validation before AI analysis

### AI Analysis Validation
- Minimum text length requirements
- Resume content structure validation
- Expected section detection (experience, education, skills)
- Response format validation with fallback handling

### Payment Session Management
- UUID-based session tracking
- Client reference ID mapping to analysis records
- Session verification before premium service delivery
- Graceful handling of payment cancellation/failure

This codebase prioritizes maintainability, testing, and production reliability over feature complexity, making it suitable for real-world deployment with paying customers.
